# Introduction 

## What is R 
R is both a programming language and software environment for statistical computing, which is free and open-source. 

The \emph{R Project} was initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka (University of Auckland) in the early 1990s as a different implementation of the S language.

Since 1997, R has been developed by the \emph{R Development Core Team}.

R is platform independent and can run on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Unix/Linux systems.

## Getting Started 
To get started, you'll need to install two pieces of software:

- R, the actual programming language. <https://cran.r-project.org>

- RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with R. <https://www.rstudio.com>

Why RStudio?\footnote{\scriptsize You must have installed R before using RStudio.}

- Easier to use (everything is in one space)

- Many useful integrations (e.g. shiny, R-projects, R-markdown, ...)

- Plenty of shortcuts (alt + shift + k)

- Plenty of cheatsheets (see top panel)

## Glossary 
- \emph{command}: user input (text or numbers) that R understands

- \emph{script}: a sequence of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line

- \emph{environment}: a list of named variables that we have generated by means of commands

- \emph{history}: the list of past commands thaty we have used 

- \emph{help}: a documentation of all the functions in R (the user manual)

- \emph{package}: a collection of additional functions and dataset

```
\normalsize

## R as a calculator (II) 
\footnotesize
```{r calculator2, include=T, echo=T}

exp(1)
log(exp(1))
sqrt(25)
```
\normalsize

## The help 
\footnotesize
```{r help, include=T, echo=T}
?log
help(log)
```
\normalsize

Otherwise:

- Google your error message

- Ask for help in Stack Overflow

## Packages 
R comes with a number of built-in functions and datasets, but one of the main strengths of R as an open-source project is its package system. 

Packages add additional functions and datasets. 

Frequently if you want to do something in R, and it is not available by default, there is a good chance that there is a package that will fulfill your needs.

You can install packages using the command `install.packages()`

You can load packages using the command `library()`

# Data structures 

## Data types 

- Numeric/Double (e.g. 2.5, 1/5, 1.0, \dots)

- Integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3, \dots)

- Complex (e.g. 1 + 2i, \dots)

- Logical (e.g. TRUE, FALSE or NA)

- Character (e.g. "a", "b", "paper", \dots)

- Factor/Categorical ("male", "female", \dots)

## Data structures 
![Visualization of data structures](~/Google Drive/T_2019c_UCA_ETRICS/figures/r_data_structures.png)

## Vectors (I)

You can create a vector using the command `c()`
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_base, include=T, echo=T}
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 10)
x
```
\normalsize

Vectors must contain elements of the same data type.
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_type, include=T, echo=T}
c(1, "intro", TRUE)
```
\normalsize

You can measure the lenght of a vector using the command `length()`
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_length, include=T, echo=T}
length(x)
```
\normalsize

## Vectors (II)
It is also possible to easily create sequences
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_sequences, include=T, echo=T}
1:10
seq(from = 1, to = 2, by = 0.1)
rep("A", times = 5) 
```
\normalsize

## Vectors (III)
You can combine different vectors
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_multiple, include=T, echo=T}
x <- 1:3 # from 1 to 3
y <- c(10, 15) # 10 and 11
z <- c(x,y) # x first and then y
z
```
\normalsize

And you can repeat vectors (or its elements)
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_repeat, include=T, echo=T}
z <- rep(y, each=3) # repeat each element 3 times
z
z <- rep(y, times=3) # repeat the whole vector 3 times
z
```
\normalsize

## Subsetting Vectors
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_subset, include=T, echo=T}
x <- c(1,5,10,7) 
x < 6 # elements lower than 6?
x == 10 # elements equal to 10?
x[2] # element in the second position?
x[1:2] # elements in the first 2 positions?
x[c(1,3,4)] # elements in position 1, 3, 4?
```
\normalsize

## Vectors' Operations
\footnotesize
```{r vectors_operations, include=T, echo=T}
x <- c(1,5,10,7)
x+2 # adds a scalar to all elements
x^2 # squares all elements
```
\normalsize

## Matrices (I)
You can create a matrix using the command `matrix()`
\footnotesize
```{r matrix, include=T, echo=T}
X <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
X
```
\normalsize

## Matrices (II)
R automatically inserts elements by columns, but we can ask to include by rows
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_byrow, include=T, echo=T}
X <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
X
```
\normalsize

You don't even have to specify the options names
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_silent, include=T, echo=T}
X <- matrix(1:8, 2, 4, T)
X
```
\normalsize

## Matrices (III)
Matrices can also be created by combining vectors
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_fromvectors, include=T, echo=T}
X <- cbind(1:4, 6:9) # binds them as columns
X
X <- rbind(1:4, 6:9) # binds them as rows
X
```
\normalsize

## Subsetting Matrices
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_subset, include=T, echo=T}
X>5 # elements larger than 5
X[1,4] # element of first row, fourth column?
X[1,] # element in the first row?
X[,2] # elements in the second columns?
```
\normalsize

## Matrices' Operations (I)
Let's create two matrices `X` and `Y`:
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_operations1, include=T, echo=T}
x <- c(1,5,4,9)
y <- c(2,4,1,3)
X <- matrix(x, 2, 2)
Y <- matrix(y, 2, 2)
X
Y
```
\normalsize

## Matrices' Operations (II)
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_operations2, include=T, echo=T}
X+Y   # element by element (also subtraction is equal)
X*Y   # element by element multiplication
X%*%Y # matrix multiplication
```
\normalsize

## Matrices' Operations (III)
\footnotesize
```{r matrix_operations3, include=T, echo=T}
solve(Y) # inverse
t(X) # transpose
```
\normalsize

## Arrays (I)
\footnotesize
```{r arrays, include=T, echo=T}
x <- 1:4
X <- array(data = x, dim = c(2,3,2))
X
```
\normalsize

## Notes about the Arrays

- Remember that vectors, matrices and arrays can include only data types of the same kind.

- An 3D array is basically a combination of matrices each laid on top of other (e.g. write N matrix in N different pages in your notebook)

- A 4D array is basically a combination of arrays each laid on top of other (e.g. take two notebooks of 3D arrays)

- A 5D array ...

- Pay attention to the `recycling rule`

## Lists
A list is a one-dimensional heterogeneous data structure.

It is indexed like a vector with a single integer value (or a name), but each element can contain an element of any data type.
\footnotesize
```{r list, include=T, echo=T}
x <- 1:4
y <- c("a", "b", "c")
L <- list(numbers = x, letters = y)
L
```
\normalsize

## Subsetting Lists
\footnotesize
```{r list_subsetting, include=T, echo=T}
L[[1]] # extract the first element
L$numbers # extract the element called numbers
L$letters # extract the element called letters
```
\normalsize

You can even "work" with the subsetted element:
\footnotesize
```{r list_subsetting2, include=T, echo=T}
L$numbers[1:3] > 2
```
\normalsize

## Data Frames (I)
A `data.frame` is similar to a typical `spreadsheet` in excel.

There are rows, and there are columns.

A row is typically thought of as an \emph{observation}.

A column is a certain \emph{variable}, characteristic or feature of that observation.

## Data Frames (II)
A data frame is a list of column vectors where:

- each column has a name

- each column must contain the same data type, but the different columns can store different data types.

- each column must be of same length

## Data Frames (III)
\scriptsize
```{r dataframe, include=T, echo=T}
set.seed(1)
df <-  data.frame(id = 1:5,
  name = c("Ted", "Barney", "Lily", "Marshall", "Robin"),
  surname = c("Mosby", "Stinson", "Aldrin", "Eriksen", "Scherbatsky"),
  wage = rnorm(n=5, mean = 1000, sd = 100), # normal random sample
  origin = c("Cleveland", "New York", "New York", "St. Cloud", "Canada"),
  male = c(T, T, F, T, F)
  )
df
```
\normalsize

You can verify the size of the `data.frame` using the command `dim()`

You can get the `data type` info using the command `str()`

## Subsetting Data Frames (I)
\footnotesize
```{r dataframe_subset, include=T, echo=T}
df$name # subset a column
df[,c(2,5)] # can also subset like a matrix
```
\normalsize

## Subsetting Data Frames (II)
\footnotesize
```{r dataframe_subset2, include=T, echo=T}
head(df, n=3) # first n observations
tail(df, n=3) # last n observations
```
\normalsize

## Inspecting data frames (I)
R comes with many data bases included. These can be used for learning R.

One of the most famous is the one called `mtcars`.
\scriptsize
```{r dataframe_mtcars, include=T, echo=T}
head(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
```
\normalsize

## Inspecting data frames (II)
\scriptsize
```{r dataframe_mtcars2, include=T, echo=T}
str(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
```
\normalsize

## Subsetting data frames (III)
We are interesting in the cylinders and the weights of inefficient cars (lower than 15 miles per gallon).
\scriptsize
```{r dataframe_subset_mtcars, include=T, echo=T}
poll_cars <- mtcars[mtcars$mpg<15, c("cyl", "wt")]
poll_cars
```
\normalsize

## Subsetting data frames (IV)
Alternatively:
\scriptsize
```{r dataframe_subset_mtcars2, include=T, echo=T}
poll_cars <- subset(mtcars, subset = mpg<15, select = c("cyl", "wt"))
poll_cars
```
\normalsize

## Importing data frames (I)
You can import csv data using:
\scriptsize
```{r import_data2, include=T, echo=T}
setwd("~/Google Drive/T_2019c_UCA_ETRICS/data/")
nyc_ab <- read.csv("AB_NYC_2019.csv")
```
\normalsize

where:

- `setwd()` sets the working directory to the place where the data is saved;

- `read.csv()` loads the csv file with the specified name.

# Basic Programming

## Variables
In programming, a variable denotes an object (i.e. a variable is a name or a label for something).
\scriptsize
```{r variables, include=T, echo=T}
x <- 1
f <- function(x){x*2+2}
```
\normalsize
Notice that the argument x of the function is different from the x previously defined. The second is only local to the function and always required to be specified.

Try to compute `r f(1)` or `r f(9)`.

## Control Flows (I)
Also known as an if/else statement. It relates to ways in which you can adapt your code to different circumstances.

Based on a condition being TRUE, your program will do one thing, as opposed to another thing. 

In R, the if/else syntax has the following structure:
\scriptsize
```{r controlflow_prepare, include=F, echo=F}
condition <- T
do_something <- "do something"
do_something_different <- "do something different"
```
\normalsize

\scriptsize
```{r controlflow, include=T, echo=T}
if (condition == TRUE) { 
  do_something
} else {
  do_something_different
}
```
\normalsize

## Control Flows (II) - Example
\scriptsize
```{r controlflow2, include=T, echo=T}
x <- 1
y <- 3
if (x>y) {
  print("x is larger than y")
  z <- x*y
  print(paste0("z is equal to ", z))
} else {
  print("x is smaller or equal than y")
  z <- x*y - 1
  print(paste0("z is equal to ", z))
}
```
\normalsize

## Control Flows (III) - Example with more conditions
\scriptsize
```{r controlflow3, include=T, echo=T}
x <- 3
y <- 3
if (x>y) {
  print("x is larger than y")
  z <- x*y + 1
  print(paste0("z is equal to ", z))
} else if (x==y) {
  print("x is equal than y")
  z <- x*y
  print(paste0("z is equal to ", z))
} else {
  print("x is smaller than y")
  z <- x*y - 1
  print(paste0("z is equal to ", z))
}
```
\normalsize

## Loops (I)
As the name suggests, in a loop the program repeats a set of instructions many times, until some condition tells it to stop.

A very powerful, yet simple, construction is that the program can count how many steps it has done already - which may be important to know for many algorithms. 

The syntax of a `for` loop is the following:
\scriptsize
```{r loops, include=T, echo=T}
for (i in 1:10){
  # does not have to be 1:10! 
  # loop body: gets executed each time
  # the value of i changes with each iteration
}
```
\normalsize

## Loops (II) - Example
Produce a loop that displays the double of the loop round.
\scriptsize
```{r loops2, include=T, echo=T}
for (i in 1:5){ 
  y <- i*2
  print(y)
}
```
\normalsize

## Loops (III) - Example with more loops
You can even have loops into other loops. 

These can be useful for exploring combinations of events:
\scriptsize
```{r loops3, include=T, echo=T}
quantity <- c(2,3)
fruits <- c("mangos", "apples", "bananas")

for (i in quantity){ # first nest: for each i
  for (j in fruits){ # second nest: for each j
    print(paste("Can I get",i,j,"please?")) 
    }
}
```
\normalsize

## Functions (I)
So far we have been using functions, but haven’t actually discussed some of their details. 

A function is a set of instructions that R executes for us, much like those collected in a script file. 

The good thing is that functions are much more flexible than scripts, since they can depend on input arguments, which change the way the function behaves. 

## Functions (II)
Here is how to define a function in general:
\scriptsize
```{r functions, include=T, echo=T}
function_name <- function(arg1 ,arg2=default_value){
  # function body
  # you do stuff with arg1 and arg2
  # you can have any number of arguments, with or without defaults 
  # any valid `R` commands can be included here
  # the last line is returned
}
```
\normalsize

## Function (III) - Example
\scriptsize
```{r functions2, include=T, echo=T}
hello <- function(your_name = "Lord Vader"){ 
  paste("You R most welcome,", your_name)
  # we could also write:
  # return(paste("You R most welcome,",your_name))
}
# we call the function by typing it's name with round brackets
```

```{r functions3, include=T, echo=T}
hello()
hello("Mattia")
```
\normalsize

# Working with Data (`tydiverse` library)

## Tidyverse
The tidyverse is acollection of R packages designed for data science. 

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

Useful info here: <https://www.tidyverse.org>

Install it with the command `install.packages("tidyverse")`

Load it with the command `library(tidyverse)`

## Tidyverse packages (some of them)

The core `tidyverse` package includes (among the others)

- `magrittr` operators and verbs to decrease development time and improve readability of code (i.e. \emph{to make your code smokin'})

- `dplyr` set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges

- `tidyr` set of functions that help you get to tidy data.

- `readr` and `readxl` fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like .csv and .xls)

- `ggplot2` system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The \emph{Grammar of Graphics} (next section)

\bf{Note}: it does not contain the `reshape2` package!

## from magrittr: the pipe operator
We'll learn the new commands using the `mtcars` dataset.

The operator `%>%` (Cmd + Shift + M) pipes the left-hand side values forward into expressions that appear on the right-hand side -- e.g. one can replace f(x) with x %>% f().

\scriptsize
```{r pipe_operator, include=T, echo=T}
9 %>% 
  sqrt() %>%  # 3
  + 22        # 25
```

```{r pipe_operator_mtcars, include=T, echo=T}
mtcars %>% 
  subset(mpg<15)
```
\normalsize

## from dplyr: `select()` variables by columns
Rather than using the `$` you can use select
\scriptsize
```{r dplyr_select, include=T, echo=T}
?dplyr::select
```

```{r dplyr_select2, include=T, echo=T}
head(select(mtcars, c(mpg, cyl)))
```
\normalsize

## from dplyr: `filter()` variables by row conditions
Rather than using the `subset` function you can use `filter`
\scriptsize
```{r dplyr_filter, include=T, echo=T}
?dplyr::filter
```

```{r dplyr_filter2, include=T, echo=T}
filter(mtcars, mpg<15)
```
\normalsize

But...we lose the names of the cars!!

## combining dplyr and magrittr
We can combine into a easily readable format functions from the two packages.
\scriptsize
```{r dplyr_magrittr, include=T, echo=T}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column('name') %>% # from library tibble 
  select(name, mpg, cyl) %>% 
  filter(mpg<15)
```
\normalsize

## from dplyr: `mutate()` variables
What if we would like to measure consumption in km/l rather than m/g or if we need to measure the `log` of horsepowers.
\scriptsize
```{r dplyr_mutate, include=T, echo=T}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column('name') %>%
  select(name, mpg, hp) %>% 
  filter(mpg<15) %>% 
  mutate(kml = mpg*0.425144) %>% # 0.425144 is the conversion ratio
  mutate(lhp = log(hp))
```
\normalsize

## from dplyr: `arrange()` variables
What if we don't like the order of the variables?

And what if we'd like to display them from most to least efficient (in terms of km/l) 

\scriptsize
```{r dplyr_arrange, include=T, echo=T}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column('name') %>%
  select(name, mpg, hp) %>% 
  filter(mpg<15) %>% 
  mutate(kml = mpg*0.425144) %>% # 0.425144 is the conversion ratio
  mutate(lhp = log(hp)) %>% 
  select(name, mpg, kml, hp, lhp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(kml))
```
\normalsize

## from tidyr: `gather()` data frames
\scriptsize
```{r tidyr_gather, include=T, echo=T}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column('name') %>%
  select(name, mpg, hp) %>% 
  filter(mpg<15) %>% 
  mutate(kml = mpg*0.425144) %>% # 0.425144 is the conversion ratio
  select(name, mpg, kml) %>% 
  gather(key = "variable", "value", -name)
```
