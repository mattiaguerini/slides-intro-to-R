# Slides "Intro to R"

Here you can find the slides I have created for the course "Introduction to R" which I gave to the Master students in Economics at the Université Côte d'Azur during the fall semester of the 2019-2020 academic year.

The slides have been generated with R Markdown using the `knitr` library.
